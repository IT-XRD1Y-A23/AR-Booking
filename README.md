XR Lab booking

The project is about a booking system for the XR lab. It will be developed for Android devices. 
It will be in the form of the XR lab model being in a miniature overlay over some surface in the environment you are in (perhaps a table in your room), meaning it can be done remotely. It is possible to pick a specific time span so that it is possible to book in advance. The free tables will be highlighted with a green outline. You can see your current bookings, and able to delete them too. 

Possible ways to expand the scope

•	Toggling between having the room model as an overlay and walking through the physical room and booking them by walking up to a table. In the second scenario, we can have the room calibrated by PLAQUE.  
•	It could be possible to expand from booking only the XR lab to booking other facilities like the group rooms on specific floors.
